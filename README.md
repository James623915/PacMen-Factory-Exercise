# PacMen-Factory-Exercise
## Description
Create a new pacMan by clicking the Add PacMan button. It should appear at a random position on the screen. You can create many PacMen by making multiple clicks. When you click Start Game button, the created pacMan or Pacmen should start moving at random velocity on the screen. When a created Pacman is hitting the edge of the screen, it should change position and stay within the frame of the web page. 
I am planning to improve my PacMen by making their mouth open and close while they are on their moves.
