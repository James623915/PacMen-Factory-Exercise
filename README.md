# PacMen-Factory-Exercise
Create a new pacMan by clicking the Add PacMan button. It should appear at a random position on the screen. You can create many PacMen by making multiple clicks. When you click Start Game button, the created pacMan or Pacmen should start moving at random velocity on the screen. When a created Pacman is hitting the edge of the screen, it should change position and stay within the frame of the web page. 

## Description
This project helps me learn how to produce a PacMan on the click button. It uses the array methods that we have learn from the previous class and the new techiques to manupulate the DOM.
